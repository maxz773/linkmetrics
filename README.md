# LinkMetrics - A LinkedIn Post Analyzer

> LinkMetrics is an AI-powered toolkit designed for **growth hackers** and **B2B marketers**. It forecasts the **virality potential** of a LinkedIn post, decodes **audience sentiment**, and identifies high-value leads against your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Dual-Mode Input📤

- #### *via URL*

  Input the `URL` of a LinkedIn post and an `ICP description`. The system will automatically extract the post, comments, and commenters' profiles, then run a multi-dimensional analysis.
  
- #### *via CSV*

  Upload your own `post_data.csv` and `comments_data.csv` files along with an `ICP description` to bypass the scraping phase and directly run the analysis.

### 2. Three-Dimensional Scoring Engine 💯

- #### *Post Potential Score* <kbd>1-10</kbd>
   Evaluates the hook, readability, value, and CTA of the post's text using an external LLM. Includes actionable advice for improvement.
   
- #### *Comment Sentiment Score* <kbd>1-10</kbd>
   A batch sentiment analysis pipeline powered by a local BERT model to gauge the overall audience reaction.
   
- #### *ICP Match Score* <kbd>1-10</kbd>
   A hybrid scoring engine combining rule-based heuristics (followers, likes, account type) and semantic vector similarity (SentenceTransformers) to determine how well the commenters match your target audience.

### 3. Containerized Deployment 🐳

To safely handle complex system-level dependencies (like Chromium for Selenium) and heavy ML libraries (PyTorch, Transformers) without environment conflicts, the project provides full Docker support.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Create a `secrets` directory and securely inject your AIHubMix API key:

     ```bash
     mkdir backend/secrets
     echo "your_real_api_key_here" > backend/secrets/aihubmix_api_key.txt
     ```
3. Launch the system:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```

The orchestration will automatically spin up the FastAPI backend, the Nginx static frontend, and securely mount the required data volumes.

## 💡 Engineering Highlights

This project is built with production-readiness and scalability in mind, incorporating several software engineering best practices:

* ***Asynchronous Non-Blocking I/O:*** \
  Leverages `run_in_threadpool` to offload synchronous Selenium scraping tasks. This prevents the FastAPI event loop from freezing, ensuring high responsiveness and concurrent request handling.

* ***Hot-Swappable Model Integration:*** \
  Decouples core logic from specific models. Both the LLM and BERT pipelines support **dynamic model parameters**, allowing seamless **hot-swapping of models** within their operational contexts.

* ***Smart In-Memory LRU Caching:*** \
  Optimizes inference speed by maintaining a custom LRU cache that keeps high-frequency local models **resident in RAM**, eliminating **cold-start latencies** from disk I/O. \
  To ensure system stability, a strict capacity limit automatically evicts the oldest models and triggers `gc.collect()`, preventing Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors even under heavy workloads.

* ***Secure Config Management:*** \
  Leverages **Docker Secrets** for file-based credential injection at `/run/secrets/`, managed via a dedicated `config.py` module. This ensures API keys are decoupled from the codebase and shielded from environment variable leakage.

* ***Safe Resource Lifecycle:*** \
  Implements the `DataExtractor` as a Python Context Manager (`__enter__`/`__exit__`). This guarantees that Selenium browser instances are always terminated and system resources are cleaned up, even if an exception occurs.

* ***Resilient Web Scraping:*** \
  Uses `WebDriverWait` with dynamic explicit waits instead of static `time.sleep()`. This makes the scraping process robust against network latency and fluctuating page load speeds.
